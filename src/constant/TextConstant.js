We take into consideration the inflation rate of the United States, which has been ~2% and is expected to remain roughly the same. We also take into consideration expense ratio for your retirement plan.  While your expense ratio may vary depending on the funds you have selected, by default, we'll assume that your expense ratio is at 0.3%, which is on the lower end of the spectrum. Keep in mind that your portfolio's expense ratio may be different. If your expense ratio is greater than 0.75%, we recommend restructuring your portfolio. After inputting all of your information, you will see a breakdown of how your plan will grow throughout the years. If you're confused with any of the terminology, please check out the Glossary.`

  title: `How Much Should I Put Into Retirement?`,
  content: `How much you invest into your retirement is completely dependent on how much you think you'll need in the future. Typically, the rule of thumb is to put between 10 to 15 percent of your income in your retirement. Due to the power of compounding interest, we highly recommend starting as early as possible and as much as possible. If you cannot put more than 10 to 15 percent, put in as much as you can afford to, and if your employer offers an employer match, you should definitely put enough to get the full match.`

However, once you're in retirement, your withdrawals are taxed at your then-current income tax rate, meaning you'll be taxed at the income rate of how much you withdraw. 401(k) is good for someone who expects to have a higher income than how much they'll be withdrawing in retirement. The limit for 401(k) as of 2020 is $19,500 per year and there is no income limit.`,

      content: `If your company offers an HSA, you have the ability to contribute your balance into an investment account, instead of letting the money sit and depreciate with inflation. An HSA is typically considered a triple tax-advantaged account as you can contribute to your HSA tax-free, your savings will grow tax-free, and you can use your HSA for qualified medical expenses tax-free. It is estimated that a newly retired 65 year old couple will need ~$300,000 for medical expenses in retirement. You can also take money out of your HSA after the age of 65, but it'll be subject to regular income tax. The limit for HSA as of 2020 is $3,550 per year and there is no income limit. Keep in mind, if you want to invest into an HSA account, you'll need to have the high-deductible insurance plan offered by your employer.`
